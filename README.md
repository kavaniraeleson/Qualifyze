Welcome to your new dbt project!

# Project Name:Qualifyze Analytics Project with dbt

## Overview

This project utilizes dbt (data build tool) to transform and analyze data from Google BigQuery. The goal is to answer various business questions by transforming raw datasets into meaningful insights.

## Data Loading and Connection

### Google BigQuery

1. **Loading Data:** Raw datasets were loaded into Google BigQuery from google sheet.
2. **Connection:** dbt is connected to Google BigQuery to leverage its capabilities for data transformation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

- `raw_data`: Contains raw datasets models obtained from external sources.
- `transformed_data`: Contains the resulting dbt models transformed to answer business questions.

## Schema Tests

The `schema.yml` file under `raw_data` and `transformed_data` defines tests to ensure data quality in the raw models. Tests include checking for uniqueness, null values, and accepted values.
More details about the test can be found on the test folder of the project.

## Transformations

### Customer Engaegement Evolution

The `customer_engagement_evolution.sql` transformation in `transformed_data` addresses the business question related to customer evolution.

#### Transformation Logic:

- I identify customers who transitioned from individual audit requests to subscription models.
- Then I the `raw_data_requests` and `raw_data_credit_packages` tables.
- Also I use  `CASE` statement to categorize customers based on their request id and credit package type.
- This generates a `customer_engagement_evolution` table.

### Subscription Data Integration

The `subscription_data_integration.sql` transformation in `transformed_data` addresses the question on the subscription of the customers.

#### Transformation Logic:

- I perform join on the `raw_data_credit_packages` and `raw_data_requests` tables.
- The logic is to provide insights into different subscription types and their associations with customer profiles.
- This generates a `subscription_data_integration` table.

### Credit Package Utilization

The `credit_package_utilization.sql` transformation in `transformed_data` analyzes credit package utilization and expiry.

#### Transformation Logic:

- Joins the `raw_data_credit_packages` and `raw_data_requests` tables.
- Then I track credit utilization against their expiration dates.
- This provides insights into credit usage rates and unused credits.
- And then generates a `credit_package_utilization` table.

## How to Run

1. Ensure your dbt profiles.yml file is correctly configured with your Google BigQuery connection details.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project in the terminal.
3. Run `dbt run` to execute the transformations.
4.  Run `dbt test` to test the models and ensure data validity.
5. Run `dbt docs generate` to generate documentation.
6. Run `dbt docs serve` to view the documentation in your browser.
